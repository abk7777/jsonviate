        "Description": "Precision medicine refers to the use of prevention and treatment strategies that are tailored to the unique features of each individual and their disease. In the context of cancer this might involve the identification of specific mutations shown to predict response to a targeted therapy. The biomedical literature describing these associations is large and growing rapidly. Currently these interpretations exist largely in private or encumbered databases resulting in extensive repetition of effort. Realizing precision medicine will require this information to be centralized, debated and interpreted for application in the clinic. CIViC is an open access, open source, community-driven web resource for Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer. Our goal is to enable precision medicine by providing an educational forum for dissemination of knowledge and active discussion of the clinical significance of cancer genome alterations.",

TILs are proving to be an important biomarker in cancer patients as they can play a part in killing tumor cells, particularly in some types of breast cancer. Identifying and measuring TILs can help to better target treatments, particularly immunotherapy, and may result in lower levels of other more aggressive treatments, including chemotherapy.\"\n",

Sentinel-2 consists of twin satellites, Sentinel-2A (launched 23 June 2015) and Sentinel-2B (launched 7 March 2017). The two satellites have the same orbit, but 180\u00b0 apart for optimal coverage and data delivery. Their combined data is used in the Digital Earth Africa Sentinel-2 product.\nTogether, they cover all Earth\u2019s land surfaces, large islands, inland and coastal waters every 3-5 days.\nSentinel-2 data is tiered by level of pre-processing. Level-0, Level-1A and Level-1B data contain raw data from the satellites, with little to no pre-processing. Level-1C data is surface reflectance measured at the top of the atmosphere. This is processed using the Sen2Cor algorithm to give Level-2A, the bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance (Obreg\u00f3n et al, 2019). Level-2A data is the most ideal for research activities as it allows further analysis without applying additional atmospheric corrections.\nThe Digital Earth Africa Sentinel-2 dataset contains Level-2A data of the African continent. Digital Earth Africa does not host any lower-level Sentinel-2 data.\nNote that this data is a subset of the Sentinel-2 COGs dataset.\n",
